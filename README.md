# Project: Detecting Anomalous Transactions

Fraud doesnâ€™t just cost money, it costs trust. As a key member of a financial compliance team, my mission is to uncover suspicious transactions that might otherwise slip through the cracks. With the stakes this high, my insights could be the difference between stopping fraud in its tracks or letting it go unnoticed.

In this project, I harness the power of IForest from pyod.models to detect anomalies in banking data. My task: flag unusual transactions, summarize my findings, and deliver actionable insights that ensure trust, security, and efficiency in financial operations.
